# NestJS Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use NestJS. Mainly made to help CJR developers.

## Examples

Each example is a separate NestJS project. To run an example, you need to install its dependencies and run it.

Until now we have the following examples:

- [x] [Template](./nestjs-template/), good to start a new project
- [x] [Authentication](./nestjs-auth/), uses JWT and Passport with a refresh token strategy
- [ ] Mailer
- [ ] Google login
- [ ] Google Cloud Storage
- [ ] ...

Each example has its own README.md file with instructions on how to run it, and explanations on how it works.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new examples or improving existing ones. 

If you want to add a new example, you can. Try to follow the same structure as the others.
